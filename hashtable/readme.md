# HashTable

## HashTable

## Hashtable is an array of a list. Each list is known as a bucket. The position of the bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method

## Challenge

## create HashTable class with out using the Hashtable library (method)

## Approach & Efficiency

## created a HashNode class and a HashTable class the node have a key value and a pointer to another node we hash the key then we store it in the hashtable array .

## API

## create a add method takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table

## create a get method that takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

## create a contains method that takes in the key and returns a boolean true if exist flase if not , indicating if the key exists in the table already .

## create a hash that takes in an key and returns an index for that key in the collection .
