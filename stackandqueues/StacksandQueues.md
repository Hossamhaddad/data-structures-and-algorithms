# Stacks and Queues
### Stacks and Queues are a linear data structure and the element can be added or delete only from one side 

## Challenge
### implement a stack and queue data structure without using the bulit in stacks and queues librarys 

## Approach & Efficiency
### created a node class with a value and next node and use it to implement the stack and queue methods 

## API
## Stack methods : 
### 1- push : is a method used to push an element on the top of the stack 
### 2- pop: is a method used to delete the top element of the stack
### 3- peek : is a method used to return the value of the top element in the stack
### 4- isEmpty : is a method that returns true of the stack is empty and false if the stack is not empty 

## Queue Methods : 
### 1-enqueue : is a method that adds an element to the queue 
### 2-dequeue : is a method that removes the front element of the queue 
### 3-peek  :is a method that returns the value of the front element in the queue 
### 4-isEmpty : is a method that returns true if the queue is empty and flase  if the queue is not empty
